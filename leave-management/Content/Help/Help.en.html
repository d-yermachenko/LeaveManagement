<p>This example allows you to simulate the leave management in your company. You can ask the administrator to create your company or create your own test company and then edit leave types and test employees for your company.

After leave was allocated, opens possibility to make the leave requests. Then manager is able to accept or reject your leave request.</p>
<h1>Creating test company</h1>
<p>
    This DEMONSTRATION possibility allows to create the test company with 4 default fake leave types and with 3-8 fake employees. You need only the name of your test company and WORKING email address to receive all demo passwords. I suggest you to use temporary email, that you can instantly obtain from the sites like

        <li><a href="https://temp-mail.org/">https://temp-mail.org/</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.fakemail.net/">https://www.fakemail.net/</a>
